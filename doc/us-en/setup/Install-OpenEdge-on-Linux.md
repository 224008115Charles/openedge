# Install OpenEdge on Linux

> OpenEdge is mainly developed in Go programming language and supports two startup modes: ***docker*** container mode and ***native*** process mode.

This document focuses on the installation and configuration of the environment required for OpenEdge and the rapid deployment of OpenEdge on the Linux-like system.

## Environment configuration

### Install Docker

> OpenEdge offers two startup modes. To start using ***docker*** container mode (recommended), you need to complete the docker installation first.

Can be installed by the following command(Suitable for linux-like systems, [Supported Platforms](./Support-platforms.md)):

```shell
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
```

#### Ubuntu

Command:

```shell
sudo snap install docker # Ubuntu16.04 after
sudo apt install docker.io # Ubuntu 16.04 before
```

#### CentOS

Command:

```shell
yum install docker
```

***Notice***: 

+ After the Docker installation is complete, use the following command to view the installed Docker version.

```shell
docker version
```

+ The official Dockerfile is offered for multi-stage builds. If you need to build the relevant image yourself, The version of docker you installed should be above 17.05.
+ The production environment can run the image using a lower version of Docker, which is currently tested to a minimum usable version of 12.0.

#### Debian 9/Raspberry Pi 3

Command:

```shell
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
```

**For more details, please see the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/).**

### Install Python2.7 and Python runtime dependency package

> + OpenEdge provides Python Runtime, which supports running code written in Python version 2.7. If you plan to start using ***native*** process mode, you need to install Python 2.7 and the package you depend on. If you plan to start in ***docker*** container mode, you do not need to perform the following steps.

#### Ubuntu 18.04 LTS/Debian 9/Raspberry Pi 3

Commands:

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install python2.7
sudo apt install python-pip
sudo pip install protobuf grpcio
```

#### CentOs 

Execute the following command to check the installed Python version:

```shell
python -V
```

If the result is not installed, you can install it using the following command:

```shell
yum install python
yum install python-pip
yum install protobuf grpcio
```

Or install from source code:

```shell
yum install gcc openssl-devel bzip2-devel
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.15/Python-2.7.15.tgz
tar xzf Python-2.7.15.tgz
make altinstall
curl "https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py" -o "get-pip.py"
python2.7 get-pip.py
pip install protobuf grpcio
```

> Enter the command `python -V` to see that the Python version is 2.7.* and the installation is correct.

### Specify the default Python version

In some cases, you need to specify the default Python version for the above installed version. Complete with the following command (Valid after reboot):

```shell
alias python=/yourpath/python2.7
```

## Deploy OpenEdge

### Preparation Before Deployment

**Statement**:

+ The following is an example of the deployment and startup of OpenEdge on Ubuntu system. The deployment operations on other Linux distributions are basically the same as the following descriptions. It is assumed that the environment required for OpenEdge operation has been configured [before](#Environment-configuration).
+ The Ubuntu system mentioned below is based on the Linux Ubuntu 4.15.0-29-generic version of the kernel with a CPU architecture of x86_64. The relevant kernel version information is shown below:

![kernel information](../../images/setup/os.png)

OpenEdge containerized mode startup requires the Docker to be installed and the Docker service started on the running device.

### Deployment Process

- **Step1**: Select a [release](https://github.com/baidu/openedge/releases) from the OpenEdge github open source project.
- **Step2**: Open the terminal and enter the OpenEdge directory for decompression:
	- .zip: using command `unzip -d . openedge-xxx.zip`;
	- .tar.gz: using command `tar -zxvf openedge-xxx.tar.gz`;
- **Step3**: After the decompression operation is complete, go directly to the OpenEdge package directory, execute the command `bin/openedge -w .`, then view the log, and view the currently running container (via the command `docker ps`). And compare the two are consistent (assuming that other docker containers are not started in the current system);
- **Step4**ï¼šIf the results are consistent, it means that OpenEdge has started normally.

***Notice:*** The official download page only provides the docker mode executable file. If you want to run in process mode, please refer to [Build-OpenEdge-From-Source.md](./Build-OpenEdge-from-Source.md)

### Start deployment

As mentioned above, download OpenEdge archive from the OpenEdge github open source project first (also can compile from source, see [Build-OpenEdge-From-Source.md](./Build-OpenEdge-from-Source.md)), then open the terminal to enter OpenEdge directory for decompression. After successful decompression, you can find that the openedge directory mainly includes bin, etc, var, etc., as shown in the following picture.

![OpenEdge directory](../../images/setup/openedge-dir.png)

The bin directory stores the openedge executable binary file, the etc directory stores the configuration of OpenEdge, and the var directory stores the configuration and resources for the modules of OpenEdge.

Then, run the command `docker ps` to see a list of currently running containers, as shown below:

![view the docker containers status](../../images/setup/docker-ps-before.png)

It can be found that the current system does not have a docker container running.

Then, go to the decompressed OpenEdge folder, execute the command `bin/openedge -w .`, observe the log of OpenEdge startup, as shown below:

![OpenEdge startup log](../../images/setup/docker-openedge-start.png)

Obviously, OpenEdge has been successfully launched.

Finally, execute the command `docker ps` again to observe the list of currently running Docker containers. It is not difficult to find that modules such as openedge-hub, openedge-function, and openedge-remote-mqtt have been successfully started, as shown in the following picture:

![running containers](../../images/setup/docker-ps-after.png)

As mentioned above, if the steps are executed correctly, OpenEdge can be quickly deployed and started on the Ubuntu system. And operations on other Linux distributions are similar to the above.
